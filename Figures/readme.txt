Note: This directory contains scripts for generating figures in this scRNA-seq epilepsy study. All codes need to be executed
manually. The required processed data for running these scripts are located in the Data/ directory, where the Seurat objects can be 
directly loaded by reading "data1_seurat.rds" and "data2_seurat.rds". Other necessary input files for executing the codes are stored 
in the Files/ directory.
