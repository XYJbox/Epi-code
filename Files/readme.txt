Note: This directory primarily contains essential input files required for running the code and generating visualizations, excluding 
the processed data. The file out_SCENIC.loom represents the output from the pySCENIC analysis. Figures 1-3 are generated primarily 
using the processed data located in the Data directory. The files RSS_selected_CSI.csv, csi_matrix.csv, and TFs_display.csv are used
for generating Figure 4, while ast_down_GO.csv and ast_up_GO.csv are required for producing Figure 5.
